## [1.1.0]

### New in version
- [2016.01.27] - By default we now include your current ruby version and public key into User-Agent header of all requests to our API. This will help us to help you if something goes wrong. You can set your own User-Agent by providing a user_agent: 'your_user_agent' setting within uploadcare config
